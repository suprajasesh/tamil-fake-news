Fake News Detection in Tamil using Transformer-Based Approach
Abstract
The widespread use of social media has led to the spread of false information, particularly in this day where the internet is pervasive. Low-resource languages like Tamil face an even greater challenge in detecting fake news due to limited resources. To address this, we focus on creating a robust system using transformer-based models for classifying fake news in Tamil. We utilize transformer-based models like TamilBERT, LaBSE, and XLNet, trained on a large corpus of Tamil data. These models provide efficient parallel calculations, aiding in accurate classification. Our dataset contains equal proportions of true and fraudulent Tamil news samples, ensuring better accuracy. TamilBERT, designed specifically for Tamil, captures language nuances effectively. LaBSE offers language-agnostic analysis, while XLNet excels in identifying contextual links.

Introduction
The proliferation of fake news in todayâ€™s digital age raises significant concerns, especially in low-resource languages like Tamil. While numerous fake news detection systems exist for languages like English, the lack of resources poses a major challenge for Tamil. Our research aims to bridge this gap by leveraging transformer-based language models, renowned for their effectiveness in understanding complex patterns. By focusing on models like TamilBERT, LaBSE, and XLNet, specifically trained on Tamil data, we strive to develop an optimal solution for real-time detection of fake news in Tamil.
